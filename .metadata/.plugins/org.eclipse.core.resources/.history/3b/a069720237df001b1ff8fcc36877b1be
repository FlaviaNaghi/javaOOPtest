 * 		- we can have abstract methods in an abstract class: methods
 * 				without body
 * 		- if there is one abstract method: the class should be abstract as well
 * 		- ABSTRACT CLASSES CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED
 * 		- a class must inherit it to be able to use it
 * 			This class must implement the abstract methods in the
